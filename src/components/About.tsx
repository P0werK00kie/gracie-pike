              <p>
                I'm a singer-songwriter right here in Monroe, Georgia, and I believe in the power of a good story and an honest song.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Music and faith have been the two constants in my life for as long as I can remember. Growing up as one of eight kids, our home was always full of noise, love, and music. My father is a preacher, and from a young age, I saw how a song could lift a spirit and bring people together in a way that nothing else could. It was in that little country church that I first found my voice and felt the calling to share my own songs.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                My music is a reflection of my lifeâ€”my faith in God, my Southern roots, and the everyday stories of hope and struggle that we all share. It's got a country soul and a gospel heart, and every lyric I write is a piece of my story that I hope resonates with yours. For me, songwriting is like a conversation with God, and performing is my way of sharing that conversation with you.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Beyond music, I'm a business owner and, most importantly, a woman striving to live a life of faith. Whether I'm writing a new melody, running my business, or spending time with my family, my goal is the same: to shine a little light and share the grace that I've been so freely given.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                I hope my music meets you wherever you are and reminds you that you're not alone on this journey.
